== 0.9

- Now updated to support ActiveRecord 2.2. JNDI-based connections will
  automatically connect/disconnect for every AR connection pool
  checkout/checkin. For best results, set your pool: parameter >= the
  actual maximum size of the JNDI connection pool. (We'll look at how
  to eliminate the need to configure AR's pool in the future.)

== 0.8.2

- Added an optional config key called :dialect. Using :dialect allows you to
  override the default SQL dialect for the driver class being used. There are
  a few cases for this:
  - Using using Sybase w/ the jTDS driver.
  - Using rebranded drivers.
  - It makes more sense to use :dialect, rather then :driver when using JNDI.
- JRUBY-2619: Typo with :test config causing problems with dev database (Igor Minar)

== 0.8

- Because of recent API changes in trunk in preparation for JRuby 1.1, this release is not
  backward compatible with previous JRuby releases. Hence the version bump.

== 0.7

- PLEASE NOTE: This release is not compatible with JRuby releases earlier than
  1.0.3 or 1.1b2. If you must use JRuby 1.0.2 or earlier, please install the
  0.6 release.
- Release coincides with JRuby 1.0.3 and JRuby 1.1b2 releases

== 0.6

- Gem is renamed to "activerecord-jdbc-adapter" to follow new conventions
  introduced in Rails 2.0 for third-party adapters. Rails 2.0 compatibility is
  introduced.
- Add dependency on ActiveRecord >= 1.14 (from the Rails 1.1.x release)
- New drivers (jdbc-XXX) and adapter (activerecord-jdbcXXX-adapter) gems
  available separately. See the README.txt file for details.
- Plain "jdbc" driver is still available if you want to use the full
  driver/url way of specifying the driver.
- More bugfixes to Oracle and SQLServer courtesy of Ola & ThoughtWorks

== 0.5

- Release coincides with JRuby 1.0.1 release
- It is no longer necessary to specify :driver and :url configuration
  parameters for the mysql, postgresql, oracle, derby, hsqldb, and h2
  adapters. The previous configuration is still valid and compatible, but for
  new applications, this makes it possible to use the exact same database.yml
  configuration as Rails applications running under native Ruby.
- JDBC drivers can now be dynamically loaded by Ruby code, without being on
  the classpath prior to launching JRuby. Simply use "require
  'jdbc-driver.jar'" in JRuby code to add it to the runtime classpath.
