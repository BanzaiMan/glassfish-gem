* 20680 File uploading is not working when file size exceeds 10 KB
* Rails logs are wired thru the glassfish gem. Now you would be able to see the Rails log as part of glassfish_rails run.

== 0.1.2

* Scaffold created using Rails 2.0.2 adding duplicate entries with v3 gem 0.1.1
* After the execution of an Ajax request, all subsequent requests are also 
  treated as Ajax requests.
* When using observe_field for AJAX capabilities, it only works once and any 
  attempt afterwards returns the first selected dataset.
* Blank page returned if there are no Rails instances available.
* Based on comments from Thomas Enebo, have changed the way we were processing 
  requests as part of the gem.

== 0.1.1

* The name of the gem is being changed from GlassFish to glassfish. The rails 
  naming convention for the gems is with all lower case or with names that 
  contain underscore.
* Support for the applications to be deployed at the Root Context ("/") of the 
  server. The Webrick and Mongrel servers deploy the application to the root 
  context by default.
* Change the default port the server to be 3000 from 8080. Port 8080 has been 
  the default http port of the GlassFish application server, but since we are 
  targetting the Ruby on Rails market with this space, it is better to have the  
  http port set to 3000. At this stage I have also changed the SSL port from 
  the GlassFish default of 8181 to 3131 and the admin default port of 4848 to 
  be 3838.
* Provide command arguments to the script to specify the number of runtime to 
  be created. In v0.1.0 of the gem one could specify the number of runtimes if 
  it was passed in as a specified as a java system property. With this version 
  use could use the command -jruby -S glassfish_rails mephisto -n 2 to create 2 
  rails instance.
* Create instances of rails in parallel. This would speed up the startup of the 
  v3 gem
